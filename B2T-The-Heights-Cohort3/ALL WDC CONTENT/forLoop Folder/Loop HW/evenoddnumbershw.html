				//Task: Odd/Even Numbers
					//Step 1:
						//- Make loop that will iterate from 0 - 15
							//-create an array of numbers from 1 - 15
							//-start the counter (var i = 0;[counter's initialization;]; create the condtion [i < nums.length;]; Incrementation [by how much the counter should increase by, in this care it is 1 (i++)])
					//Initialization counter variable, start point
					//Make an array of numbers from 0 - 15
					var nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
						//the counter start/ the condition to loop through the array
						for(var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++ ){
							console.log('the loop is working ====> ', i)

					//Step 2
					// - for each iteration check if current number is odd or even
					// - we can use an if statement / conditional
					// - we need to use the modulus which give the remainder
					// - lets check for even numbers
						// if the number is divisible by 2 and 0 left over, the result is even
							// else, the number is odd and print out to console that it is odd
						if (i % 2 == 0){
								console.log(i,' This number is even')
						}
						else {
								console.log(i, ' This number is odd')
						}
					}

					//var nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, 13, 14, 15];
					//var evens = [];
					//var odds = [];

					//var evenNumbers = function(nums) {
    				//	for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) 

        			//if ((nums[i] % 2) != 0) {
            		//	evens.push(nums[i]);
                	//		console.log(evens);
        			//}
        			//	else {
            		//	odds.push(nums[i]);
                	//		console.log(odds);
				      //  }
						   	
				//};
				
				
				//alert (evens);
				//alert (odds);

				//the condition; how long do you want the loop to last inside the parentheses, then tell it what to do, through the output and through the document.write	
				
				//while(evenNum);{
				
				//x starts at 0, and is written to the output fourteen more times since x is less than 15, and is joined together by the "+" sign

				//document.write( evenNum +  " is an even number? <br />");
				//document.write( oddNum +  " is an odd number? <br />");
				//x++;
