Task: Fizz Buzz

Step 1: Initialization: where the counter starts from (create a variable and start the counter)
	a) Make a program which iterates the integers from 1 - 100
		i) Create a variable to hold the array 0 - 100
var nums =  [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100];
		ii) Create counter
			(i = nums)
	b) For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
		i) For multiples of 3 print i + " Fizz" instead of the number
		ii) For multiples of 5 print i + " Buzz"
		iii) For multiples of both 3 and 5 print " FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
		iiii) Output : "1" "2" "Fizz" "4" "Buzz"

Step 2: The Condition: how long should the loop run for
	a) i <= 100	

Step 3: Incrementation: by how much should the counter increase/decrease by 
	a) i++
